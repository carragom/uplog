Uplog - An UDP based ping program with an "ASCII-graphical" log file


DESCRIPTION
===========

Uplog is an UDP based ping program that gives an ASCII-graphical log
of the packet losses.

Once a second uplog sends a packet to the echo port (7) of the target host 
and waits for a reply.  If it gets a reply a X is written, otherwise a dot
(.) is written to the log file.  If a packet with a wrong sequence number 
arrives a colon (:) is written to the log file.

By examining the log file one can easily see when and how the packet losses
occur.  For instance the pattern below with 5 second sections of total
packet loss suggests that there's some kind of routing problem caused by
routing flaps.

Or just that the network is slightly overloaded during peak hours as below.

I'm currentlyy using uplog on one a Debian 3.0/i386 and a Slackware 8.1/i386 
box. I've got a report that it works on Solaris also. Other distributions are 
untested but should probably work just fine.

Please send me a mail if you get uplog up and running on one of your
machines if the platform/OS is not listed here.  

COMPILE/INSTALL
===============

Please read the INSTALL file for compile / installation issues.


RUNNING
=======

To run uplog simply give a host as the argument to uplog. The host name can
either be given as a fqdn (www.nerdlabs.org) or as a dotted quad
(195.66.47.97).

   uplog 195.66.47.97

Uplog will by default run in the background as a daemon and write the log
file to the current directory.  If you want to have the log file in another
location the location can be specified with the -l option.

   uplog -l /var/log/uplog/ 195.66.47.97

By using the -f option uplog runs in the foreground instead and writes the
log to stdout.

   uplog -f 195.66.47.97

The port to send the UDP packets to can be changed with the -p option.

   uplog -p 13 195.66.47.97

To terminate uplog when running as a daemon send a SIGHUP to it using the
kill command. You need to look up the pid of the program with ps first.

When running as a daemon all error messages are send to syslog using LOCAL7
as the facility.

Since this is the first public release I'd appreciate it very much is you
could send me a mail if you get uplog up and running on one of your
machines.  I'm using uplog on one Debian 3.0 and one Slackware 8.1 box,
all other distributions are untested but should work.
